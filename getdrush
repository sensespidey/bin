# getdrush is designed to do one thing, and do it well: get and install drush on a (debian linux) server.
# it turns out, this is getting easier, and easier, and the official way now
# involves composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally

# Step 1: get composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin

# Step 2: install drush globally for all users
# (see http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/)

# Download latest stable release manually or use code below. See
# http://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases.
wget https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases/download/8.0.0-rc4/drush.phar

# Test your install.
php drush.phar core-status

# Rename to `drush` instead of `php drush.phar`. Destination can be anywhere on $PATH. 
# on my systems, /usr/local/src is group-owned by my adm/dev group, and writable by me
chmod +x drush.phar
sudo mv drush.phar /usr/local/bin/drush

# Enrich the bash startup file with completion and aliases.
drush init

# Step 3: Profit! Print the version to confirm 
drush --version
