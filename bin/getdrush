# getdrush is designed to do one thing, and do it well: get and install drush on a (debian linux) server.

# Step 1: get pear (http://pear.php.net)
sudo apt-get install php-pear # Install the basic package

# Step 2: upgrade pear and install drush prerequisites
sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net
sudo pear upgrade --force Console_Getopt
sudo pear upgrade --force pear
sudo pear upgrade-all
sudo pear install Console_Table # Drush requires this, but can't seem to pull t in itself..

# Step 3: get the custom drush channel, and install
sudo pear channel-discover pear.drush.org
sudo pear install drush/drush
drush version # Print the version to confirm
